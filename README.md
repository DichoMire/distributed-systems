Coursework project for COMP2207 Distributed systems

It is a program that simulates a distributed file system would work over the internet on a single computer. The connections are over TCP on different ports of the machine. Files are stored and distributed over different stores - in this case folders. The system handles reads and writes of files as well as handles new stores connections and failures.
